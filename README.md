# Dictionary

This is a python script to look up words from the dictionary. Source is Webster's Unabridged Dictionary from project
gutenberg.  I built it from [this site](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ralph/OPTED/).
The dictionary is in the 19 MB sqlite3 db file.
Usage is via `dictionary -h`.

I use this to look up word when I'm reading pdfs on my laptop. Often my internet is very slow and I don't want to suffer
the frustration of searching for a definition in the browser. This is quick and works offline.
